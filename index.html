        <p>The term PHP is an acronym for – Hypertext Preprocessor. PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development. It is an open-source which means it is free to download and use. It is very simple to learn and use. The file extension of PHP is “.php”.  PHP is a server-side scripting language created primarily for web development but it is also used as a general-purpose programming language. Unlike client-side languages like JavaScript, which are executed on the user’s browser, PHP scripts run on the server. The results are then sent to the client’s web browser as plain HTML.</p>
